# AgentAmi - Roadmap
This file is a roadmap for the future features which I might implement:

1. Advanced Pruning Strategies: Exposing multiple pruning strategies to select for better token size optimization for different use cases.
2. Ability to give user to write their own pruner.
3. Option for user to select from various tool_selectors, which will be natively implemented.
